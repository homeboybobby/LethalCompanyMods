# About This Repository
This repository consists most of my lethal company mods(well, maybe not at initial release). So far it contains 7 of my mods. InfiniteSprint and NoFallDamage was simply to get a feel as to how modding works(I have never modded games before, but I sure have made games). Down below you'll have a general description for each mod. Apologies beforehand for my English. I am Hungarian :)

# Infinite Sprint
Self explanatory. It's a mod that allows the player to have infinite stamina.

# No Fall Damage
Also self-explanatory. A mod that disables fall damage entirely(on the outside, inside facilities, you can still fall to your death).

# Better Stamina
Ever felt like stamina is bland? This mod increases regeneration speed and makes the stamina last longer. Although the mod isn't advanced it sure does work.

# Safer Jetpack
The jetpack controls are extremely clunky and for that reason I have decided to fix that. Well. Sort of. This mod disallows fall damage from jetpack, removes the height limit, and a couple of other features you need to figure out for yourself(or you can just check the code).

# Health Regeneration
The health regeneration system in Lethal Company is very bare bones, and so, what if that changed? I changed value to be more safe and still make it feel like lethal company. The healing itself is very inconsistent even though healing does happen for a certain interval when critically injured. This mod expands upon the health regeneration mechanic and expands it. So if you're low on health and think you're going to die then do not fear. Because this will heal you until you have 100 HP.

# Super Speed
Ever since I watched The Flash I have been fascinated by the unnatural speed that he possesses. Therefore I made this mod entirely for fun. I made it configurable too. The key to enable super speed is "M", but beware because if you don't use any no fall damage mods, you're going to take damage when sprinting in super speed. So in essence super silly little mod!

# Phantom Mode
This is by far the most advanced mod I've made. It still doesn't remove the fact that it is horrible. There are a couple of things you need to keep in mind. One is that you cannot change to phantom mode when alive. You need to be dead. Below are the default key bindings

- "M" - Enable Phantom Mode(while in spectator mode)
- "P" - Teleport to your dead body
- "C" - Toggle bright mode(night vision mode technically)
- "B" - Teleport to the entrance outside
- "R" - Switch to spectator mode
- "O" - Toggle free roam
- "Space" - Ascend in Free Roam
- "Left Shift" - Descend in Free Roam

Things to keep in mind:
- You can jump mid air
- You can use left and right arrow to cycle through alive players
- You can interact with objects but very limited
- Enemies are going to ignore you. They can still collide with you but them colliding won't do anything
- You can only chat with dead people 

Before I get to changing the key bindings there is something you need to know. The key bindings are case sensitive, meaning that you need to put it the way I did it.
